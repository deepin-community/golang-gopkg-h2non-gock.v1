Description: HTTP traffic mocking and testing made easy in Go
 Versatile HTTP mocking made easy in Go (https://golang.org) that works
 with any net/http based stdlib implementation.
 .
 Heavily inspired by nock (https://github.com/node-nock/nock).  There is
 also its Python port, pook (https://github.com/h2non/pook).
